####Murray's stats course Day 1####

#use terminal for git
#console for R

#alt - shift - k => keyboard shortcuts


#install packages via terminal
#type R first, click enter, to be in r
#then install.packages()
#choose to download from cloud


#if package masks a function from another package add its namespace ie stats::filter() -> namespace::function()
#avoids conflicts

#polymorphism

#git good for keeping track of what has changed in a document
#good for collaboration because partner gets entire history
#each change stage is called commit - most recent change is the head - changes are relative to the head - the head can be moved
#4 stages ; untracked, staged, committed, modified
  #go to git tab - question mark = untracked
  #any files or folders you don't want to track -> write in .gitignore
